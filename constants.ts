    text: "I visited this venue as my cousin brother booked it for their daughter's 3rd birthday celebration. The venue was designed and decorated very nicely. They have an open garden dine-in place as well as a unique 'bunker of mirror' place in the center to dine in. The garden lights and the lights on the trees looked amazing at night. Though it was winter, the glass dome seating is a great option. The staff at the party were so co-operative and quickly followed every task and order. The food was good, especially the Soup and Samosa Chat. You can easily get together around 80-100 people in this open garden venue."

It's great to see more and more restaurants incorporating plant-based options. The ambiance was lovely and the service was top-notch. As someone who always looks for vegan options, I highly recommend giving Sky Dine a try. Their commitment to catering to different dietary preferences is commendable. I'll definitely be back for more delicious vegan meals."
